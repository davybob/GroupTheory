Before we begin it is assumed you have some prior knowledge about the properties of **Integers**, **Modular Arithmetic**, 
**Complex Numbers**, **Induction**, **Equivalence Relations** and **Function**. If any of these topics are hazy, I would recommend
you study up on them before proceeding. Gallian provides a good introduction to these topic in his book "Contemproray Abstract Algebra".
